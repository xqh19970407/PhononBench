# PhononBench
PhononBench is a phonon-based benchmark for large-scale dynamical stability evaluation of AI-generated crystals, featuring 100k+ structures, DFT-level MatterSim phonon calculations, and open-source high-throughput workflows.

## Installation

PhononBench relies on **MatterSim** for DFT-level phonon calculations.
We therefore **strongly recommend installing MatterSim first**, following the official environment setup, before using PhononBench.

### Prerequisites

* **Python ≥ 3.10**
* **mamba or micromamba** (recommended for fast and reliable dependency resolution)
* Linux environment (recommended for large-scale phonon calculations)

We recommend installing MatterSim **from source using mamba**, as this is the most reliable setup for large-scale phonon calculations and was the environment used in this work.

```bash
# clone MatterSim
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/mattersim.git
cd mattersim

# create the environment
mamba env create -f environment.yaml
mamba activate mattersim

# install MatterSim in editable mode
uv pip install -e .
```

## Evaluating Your Own Crystal Generation Model

PhononBench provides a standardized workflow for evaluating the **dynamical stability** of crystal structures generated by custom models.
To evaluate your own crystal generation model, follow the steps below.

---

### Step 1: Generate Crystal Structures

First, use your crystal generation model to generate a **large set of crystal structures** and save them in **CIF format**.
- We recommend generating **at least 10,000 crystal structures** to ensure that,
  after duplicate removal and structure relaxation, **more than 4,000 valid
  structures** remain for reliable dynamical stability evaluation.
- Each structure should be saved as an individual `.cif` file.

Example directory structure:

```
your_model_outputs/
├── structure_00001.cif
├── structure_00002.cif
├── ...
└── structure_10000.cif
```

---

### Step 2: Prepare Phonopy Input Files

Next, use the provided script `batch_prepare_phonopy_input.py` to automatically generate the **Phonopy input files** required for phonon calculations.

Only two arguments need to be specified:

* `--input_dir`: directory containing your generated CIF files
* `--out`: output directory for phonon calculation inputs

The supercell size is controlled by `--dim`.

Example command:

```bash
python batch_prepare_phonopy_input.py \
    --input_dir /home/xqhan/InvDesFlow3.0/Benchmark/MatterGen-gen/dft_band_gap/1.5/gen-cifs \
    --dim 2 2 2 \
    --out /home/xqhan/InvDesFlow3.0/Benchmark/MatterGen-gen/dft_band_gap/bg_1.5/phonon-calculation-input
```

This script will:

* Read all CIF files from `--input_dir`
* Build supercells according to `--dim`
* Generate compressed Phonopy input files (`.yaml.bz2`) for each structure
* Save all generated inputs to the directory specified by `--out`
